Welcome to the HOROSCOPE website, where you can explore different zodiac signs and their characteristics through interactive web pages.

## Introduction

This project is a simple yet interactive website designed to provide information about various zodiac signs. Each zodiac sign has its own dedicated HTML page with customized CSS styling to reflect the characteristics associated with that sign.

## Features

- **Zodiac Sign Pages**: Each zodiac sign (Air, Earth, Fire, Water) has its own HTML page (`AIR.html`, `EARTH.html`, `FIRE.html`, `WATER.html`) with specific content and styling.
- **CSS3 Styling**: The website utilizes multiple CSS files (`style.css`, `style1.css`, `style2.css`, `style3.css`, `style4.css`) for different pages and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Animations**: Check out the `Zodiac Signs Animation.mp4` video file for visual demonstrations of zodiac sign animations.
- **Images**: Each zodiac sign is represented by an image (`airsigns.jpg`, `earthsigns.png`, `firesigns.png`, `watersigns.png`).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any of the HTML files (`AIR.html`, `EARTH.html`, `FIRE.html`, `WATER.html`) in a web browser.
