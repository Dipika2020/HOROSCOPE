                <p>Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done? That’s the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, this air sign was interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Negative Traits</b><br>The people born under this sign are very restless and anxious. They feel lost because of their lack of consistency and decision-making ability.

                 <p>Libra is an air sign represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life.
</p>
<p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

Librans are the fairest of all and being just is one of their highest valued virtues. Governed by Venus, Librans are very loving and romantic souls. They are very tactful and know how to get things done by people. They are diplomatic but very charming people.
</p><p><b>
Negative Traits</b><br>

Decision-making can be a tedious task for the Librans. They are so indecisive that it may get difficult to trust them. They are superficial and lay more emphasis on outer beauty than inner beauty.

                 <p>Despite the “aqua” in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac. Aquarius is represented by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Accordingly, Aquarius is the most humanitarian astrological sign.
</p>
<p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

Aquarians are very creative and intelligent humans. They are very friendly and generally have a large circle of friends. Once committed in any relationship, Aquarians will remain faithful till the end. They like to be financially and emotionally independent.
</p>
<p><b>
Negative Traits</b><br>

They are extremists, and it is either this way or that way; no middle way. They sometimes become distant or aloof for no reason. They are very inconsistent and unpredictable. They may listen to people but will do what they think is right and can get extremely stubborn.
