                    <p>This rambunctious ram is a cardinal sign, aka they take charge. If you’ve ever known an Aries, chances are they charmed you with their powerful words—and then left you in the dust. They tend to use their hotheadedness to assert their views, then move on fast. Aries is the first of sign the zodiac, so they’re also leaders—the fire’s spark. </p>
                    <p><b>Positive Traits:</b><br>

Owning the true characteristics of the ram, Aries individuals are headstrong and strong-willed. They exhibit unparalleled enthusiasm and motivate others to excel too. They are straightforward, and if they have a thought in their head, they will say it loud and clear. They are courageous and brave and don’t hesitate to take risks. They are the livewires and very popular in their social circle.</p>
                    <p><b>Negative Traits:</b><br>Aries are very stubborn, and that makes it difficult to deal with them.  They are very impatient and impulsive and thus make hasty decisions. They are very disorganised and undisciplined. They like confrontations and arguments.</p>

                    <p>Sagittarius is a mutable sign, aka they’re flexible and thoughtful—kinda like the zodiac’s philosophers. They use their passionate energy to power their quest for truth. As the protector of the galaxy, the archer is a fearless spiritual fighter who never minces words. However, Sagittarius does have a habit of putting their foot in their mouth—so they adopt a “live and let live” attitude to get them out of trouble.</p>
                    <p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

Sagittarians are deep thinkers and philosophers. They like truth, nothing but the truth. They are straightforward in their dealings too. If you wish to impress a Sagittarian, indulge in an intelligent conversation. They are very generous and love to help everyone.

<p><b>Negative Traits</b><br>

They are too boastful and think that they are best. They cannot be consistent in anything they do and thus get bored easily. Sagittarians hate to wait and want things to happen within no time. They are too negligent and careless.</p>
