                  <p>Cancer is a cardinal sign, which makes them able to take decisive action and manifest their dreams swiftly. They’re known as the providers of the zodiac—they take care of their loved ones as breadwinners and nurturers. The crab’s ability to crawl between the ocean and shore allows them to exist between the emotional and material worlds. Once you’re in the grasp of their claws, you can expect to remain in their clutches forever. If a situation or person makes them comfortable, they’ll hold on with all of their mighty strength. 
                 </p>
<p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

Crabs are very intuitive and rely greatly on their intuition for taking important decisions. They are extremely passionate and loving beings. Cancerians are very emotional people; however, sometimes they may seem a bit isolated and distant.
</p>
<p><b>
Negative Traits</b><br>

Crabs are very suspicious and take time to trust people. They are extremely moody and do not accept failures easily. They are very possessive and overemotional in their relationships.

                 <p>Scorpio is the only fixed water sign of the zodiac. Because of their passionate nature, they’re often mistaken for a fire sign. However, their intense energy stands second to their intuition. Scorpios rely on their gut feelings first and foremost, even before logic and reason. Their emotions run hot and high, making them unable to turn off their feels. Prepare to be stung if you hurt a scorpion, as their poisonous and venomous stingers will come out if you dare to betray this transformative sign.
</p>  
<p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

The Scorpions are highly ambitious and focused people. They are supremely passionate but not careless or immature. They are very intuitive and can guess what is going on in somebody’s mind. They are brave and can deal with most difficult situations with utmost ease.
</p>
<p><b>Negative Traits</b><br>

One of the most cunning zodiacs, Scorpions can hurt people with their words and actions. They are very secretive and jealous. They like to dominate people and situations, and they are extremely manipulative.

                <p>Mysticism and dreaminess consume the heart of tender Pisces, a mutable water sign. Their emotions change rampantly, and it takes them a long time to make a permanent decision. But once they finally commit to a feeling, they can easily swim away from ties that hold them down. Pisces are known as the psychics and creatives of the zodiac. They use their artistry to create the world they want—even if it exists only in their head.
</p>                    
<p><b>Positive Traits</b><br>

Pisceans are very affectionate and gentle souls. They are great thinkers and can come up with great ideas. One of the best features of this zodiac sign is that they are utterly sensitive towards other’s feelings and kind to the people around them. They greatly rely on their intuition when in doubt.
</p>
<p><b>Negative Traits</b><br>

They are lazy beings and often opt for an escapist approach. They are overly sensitive and can get depressed easily.
